 Course Meeting Times
---------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions/week, 1.5 hours/session

Recitations: 1 session/week, 1.5 hours/session

Prerequisites
-------------

The prerequisite for this course is _[14.123 Microeconomic Theory III](/courses/14-123-microeconomic-theory-iii-spring-2015)_ or MIT students can get permission of the instructor.

Homework and Exams
------------------

There will be a final exam that is closed book. There will be 4-5 homework sets, which are marked but do not directly count in the grade. As an empirical statement, note that YOU HAVE TO DO THE HOMEWORK TO DO WELL.

Readings
--------

I will mainly follow the textbook by Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (MWG). I also provide supplementary readings from other books, but for the most part MWG will do. Bolton and Dewatripont’s book does provide more in-depth material; it is used in _14.281 Contract Economics_, but many will find it useful also for this class. The book by Gollier is an excellent, in-depth treatment of decision making under uncertainty. It may well be worth your investment to buy the book for future reference. I have included in the reading list a few articles, either because they are classic, or because my lectures will make use of them.
